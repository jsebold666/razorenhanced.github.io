#  Welcome to your new DokuWiki 

Congratulations, your wiki is now up and running. Here are a few more tips to get you started.

Enjoy your work with DokuWiki,\\
-- the developers

##  Create your first pages 

Your wiki needs to have a start page. As long as it doesn't exist, this link will be red: [[:start]].

Go on, follow that link and create the page. If you need help with using the syntax you can always refer to the [syntax page](wiki:syntax.md).

You might also want to use a sidebar. To create it, just edit the [FAQ on sidebars](:sidebar]] page. Everything in that page will be shown in a margin column on the side. Read our [[doku>faq:sidebar.md) to learn more.

Please be aware that not all templates support sidebars.

##  Customize your Wiki 

Once you're comfortable with creating and editing pages you might want to have a look at the [configuration settings](this>doku.php?do=admin&page=config.md) (be sure to login as superuser first).

You may also want to see what [plugins](doku>plugins.md) and [templates](doku>templates.md) are available at DokuWiki.org to extend the functionality and looks of your DokuWiki installation.

##  Join the Community 

DokuWiki is an Open Source project that thrives through user contributions. A good way to stay informed on what's going on and to get useful tips in using DokuWiki is subscribing to the [[doku>newsletter]].

The [DokuWiki User Forum](http://forum.dokuwiki.org.md) is an excellent way to get in contact with other DokuWiki users and is just one of the many ways to get [support](doku>faq:support.md).

Of course we'd be more than happy to have you [getting involved](doku>teams:getting_involved.md) with DokuWiki.
